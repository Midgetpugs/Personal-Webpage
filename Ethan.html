<h1 id="ChickenRamen"> Home-Style Chicken Ramen </h1>
<p> The broth is a relatively simple but deeply flavored chicken base layered with fresh ramen noodles, poached chicken breast, soft soy eggs, and a delicate fennel oil.<br>
Sun Noodle is recommended for fresh ramen noodles, but if you can't find them, dried will do in a pinch.<br>
Common toppings you can buy include: Bamboo shoots, fish cake, pickled mustard greens, and corn kernels.<br>

<th>9 cups chicken ramen broth, divided
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 14 oz.)
1⁄2 lb. mung bean sprouts
2 green onions
20 oz. fresh ramen noodles (recommended: Sun Noodle
1 7-minute egg, sliced in half

<h1>How to Cook the Ramen:</h1> <h1>
<p> 
<li>Bring 1 quart (4 cups) ramen broth to a simmer and poach the chicken breasts for 8 minutes. Remove and cool. Slice into half-inch pieces at a slight angle. </li>
<li>Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large saucepan. Blanch the sprouts for 20 seconds, strain, and plunge in ice water to stop their cooking. Set the sprouts aside until ready to plate.</li>
<li>Make sure your ramen broth is simmering, your noodle water is boiling rapidly, and your toppings are all prepared and ready to plate. Drop 5 oz. of the noodles in the water and cook for 90 seconds. While they are boiling, ladle 1 ¼ cup (10 ounces) of broth into a soup bowl.</li>
<li>Strain the noodles and place in the bowl of broth. Pick up the noodles with chopsticks and fold them over on each other to create a bed for the toppings to sit upon. Repeat with remaining noodles and broth.</li>
<li>Garnish the bowls with the sliced chicken breast, blanched bean sprouts, and green onions. Drizzle fennel oil over the toppings.</li>
