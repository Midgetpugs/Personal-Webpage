<h1> Rouladen </h1>
<p> This dish requires you to wrap your choice of meat which consists of beef, veal, or pork around a filling of bacon or pork belly, chopped onions, pickles and mustard! <br>
After all of this, it is then both browned and simmered in broth; also known as "braised". <br>
This dish is most commonly served with gravy, dumplings, mashed potato. I would personally serve this dish with sauerkraut because I feel like it would pair very nicely with it! <br>

<h3> How to cook your homemade Rouladen </h3>
<p> <li>Take a strip of chuck roast.  It should be about 1/4 inch thick.  If it is too thick, pound it down to the correct thickness.  Spread the meat with a thin layer of mustard, then sprinkle with pepper and salt (go easy on the salt).  Put a strip or two of bacon on the meat.  This depends on how wide your meat is.  You don’t want the bacon to stick out the side.  Cover that with a thin layer of sliced onions. </li>
<li> Starting at the small end, roll the meat with it’s contents into a tight cylinder.  Using kitchen twine (or in Oma’s case, sewing thread), tie this bundle tightly. </li>
<li> Put about 2-3 tablespoons of oil in the bottom of a heavy sauté pan.  When the oil is hot, add the rouladen, and cook, turning as necessary, until it is very brown on all sides.  This takes about 22-28 minutes.  When the meat is very very brown all over, place them in a large dutch oven. </li> 
<li>Heat about 2 cups of water in small sauce pan until hot.  Pour the water into the sauté pan that you used to brown the rouladen and scrape up the drippings.  Eventually, this will be the gravy.  Pour this sauce over the meat in the dutch oven.  If you didn’t get everything from the pan, add a little more water, scrape again and pour that over the meat. </li>

<li> Bring to a boil on the stove top, then reduce heat, cover and simmer very low for 1 1/2 hours.  After the meat is tender, remove it to a plate covered with foil to stay warm. </li>
</p>
<h3> The gravy and serving! </h3>
<p>
<li> Whisk together 1/4 cups flour and 1/4 cup water until smooth.  This mixture will be the consistency of cream.  Turn the heat off on the pot and add about 1/2 this mixture to the pan juices whisking until it is incorporated.  Then turn the heat back on and simmer until it thickens.  Just before serving, mix in approximately 1/4 cup of sour cream (optional).  Taste for seasoning. </li>
<li> Cut the string off the rouladen and place one on each plate.  Cover with a generous portion of the gravy.  Serve with potatoes or pasta and something that once grew in the ground. </li>

<h1> Rote grutze </h1>
<p>
Rote grütze is a red fruit pudding that is a popular dessert in northern Germany. <br>
It’s made from black and red currants, raspberries and sometimes strawberries or cherries. <br>
These are then cooked in their juices and thickened with a little cornstarch or cornflour. <br>
It’s served with cream (sahne), milk or vanilla sauce or ice-cream. <br>
